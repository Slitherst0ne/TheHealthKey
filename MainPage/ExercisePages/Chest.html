                Start with your hands on the wall or a countertop height surface. Walk your feet back so that your body
                makes roughly a 45 degree angle with the floor.


                <br><br>Keep your body straight and your spine neutral, and lower your chest to the surface you're
                leaning against.

                <br><br>Pause for a moment, then return to the start position.

                <br><br>Make sure the resistance feels light enough to complete up to 20 repetitions. If you need to
                make it easier, step closer to your hands; to make it harder, step farther away.

            <p>
                Lie on your back on the bench with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Grasp the barbell, with
                your thumb wrapped around the barbell and palms facing toward your feet. Press your arms straight toward
                the ceiling to lift the weight off the rack.

                <br><br>Move the weight over chest level.

                <br><br>Bending your elbows down at a 45-degree angle, slowly lower the weight to your chest. Keep the
                bar approximately in line with your nipples.

                <br><br>Pause for a moment, then press the weight back to the start position.

                <br><br>Complete 3 sets of 8–12 repetitions.

                <br><br>Remember to keep your back flat and maintain good control of the weight. Also keep your neck
                neutral to avoid excessive strain. It’s recommended to enlist the help of a spotter to ensure safety in
                this exercise.

                Begin on your hands and knees, and step back into a high plank position. Your hands should be just wider
                than your shoulders, and your legs should be straight with your quads. Your hamstrings should be engaged
                and your spine neutral.

                floor, maintaining a straight line from head to heel.


                <br><br>Aim to go as low as you can without losing the support of your core or the alignment of your
                spine and pelvis.

                <br><br>Press your chest away from the ground until your elbows are straight.

                <br><br>Remember to keep your keep your hips in line with your shoulders and ankles. If this is too
                challenging to perform on your feet, you may do this exercise on your knees.
                <br>
                If you wish to increase the challenge, you can do a decline pushup by placing your toes on an elevated
                surface such as a bench or table.

                <br><br>Grasp the hands (or the ends of the band) as you step forward with 1 foot. Keep enough tension
                and control on the handles to keep them in front of your chest.

                <br><br>Contract your chest muscles and bring the handles down and forward across your body at roughly
                belly button level. The hands can cross to add emphasis to the serratus anterior muscles.
