                workout to strengthen your spine too. Moving the hips back, bend the knees and hips to lower the torso

                The assisted pull-up machine is literally designed to assist you in pulling yourself up, allowing you to
                focus on mastering form and completing reps. As you get stronger, progressively decrease the amount of
                assistance. Eventually you can start knocking out full pull-ups on your own.<br>

                <br><b>TIP:</b>Focus on the negative for building strength, using barely enough assistance to help you
                lift
                yourself back up for each repetition. Stay in the 8-10 rep range for 3-4 sets to build strength and mass

            </p>
            <p>
                Many trainers forget the T-bar row is technically a machine movement. There is a pivot point preventing
                you from having total control of the weight, so it is not a "free" weight. Whether you shove the end of
                a bar in a corner or use a landmine or a station, the T-bar row is an excellent exercise to go heavy on.

                <br><br>If you use the free-standing version without the pad to lean on, your lower back benefits as
                well as your lats. Using a horizontal grip also targets the rhomboids, teres major, mid traps, and rear
                delts.

                <br><br><b>TIP:</b> This is a chance to go super heavy on a row, so don't be afraid to pack on the
                weight and drop down to a 5x5 set-and-rep scheme to add massive weight and volume to your workout.

            <p>
                The low version of the row machine allows you to use different attachments to serve different
                purposes. The rope can help you pull in tighter and get a better contraction, the wide handle helps
                develop the upper back, and the close-grip handle helps you focus on the lats.

                <br><br>The low seated row is a versatile option for targeting any back-training weakness, so let it
                serve you in developing a well-balanced upper body.

                <br><br><b>TIP:</b> Maintain your posture! It's easy to try to throw momentum into the seated row, but a
                stable spine guarantees you isolate those back details. Work in that same 8-10 rep range, but keep that
                extra squeeze on the contraction and slow negative to maximize all this machine has to offer.

                <br><br>You may not get the big muscle pump that you get from working your other major back muscles,
                but the lower back is not something to be ignored. Developing this area can help you reach your physique
                and performance goals.

                <br><br><b>TIP:</b> Add lower back on your leg or chest day to help round out your core strength with
                antagonist training, building up that all-important lumbar region when your other big muscles are
                already gassed.

                Stand in front of a loaded barbell with your feet shoulder-width apart, hips back, and back flat. The
                knees should be bent slightly to allow you to grip the bar tightly slightly wider than shoulder-width.
                Keeping your back flat and chest up, tighten the back muscles, and straighten the arms as you load the
                pull. With everything locked, aggressively push your legs into the floor as you simultaneously pull your
                chest and shoulders upwards, lifting the bar to the hip.

                Set up as you would for your deadlift by standing feet shoulder-width apart in front of a loaded
                barbell. Hinge at the hips until your torso is about parallel to the floor. Grab the barbell with a grip
                that’s a bit wider than your typical deadlift grip. Lean back, so your weight is on your heels, and row
                the barbell, leading the pull with your elbow until it touches around your belly button.

                Set a workout bench to a 45-degree incline and lay face down on it so your chest and stomach are
                supported. Grab a dumbbell in each hand and then row them to your sides until your elbows pass your
                torso. Slowly lower the weight under control.

                Place a bar in a rack so that it is supported and stable. When you lay down underneath it, your hands
                should just reach the bar. Adjust the height as needed. Grasp the bar firmly and set the body in a rigid
                plank position. Pull your chest to the bar, making sure to keep the elbows from flaring out.
