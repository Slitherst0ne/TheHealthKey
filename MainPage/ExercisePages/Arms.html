            <p>
                To perform the preacher curl, set yourself up in the preacher curl seat with the pad set at a height
                that places the pad under your upper triceps/armpit. Doing this will not allow you to move your
                shoulders during the curl.

                <br><br>Once you are set up, grab a bar, often the curved EZ curl bar, and perform a full range of
                motion preacher curls where you take the elbow into full extension and flexion.

                <br><br><b>TIP:</b>Control the eccentric, and focus keeping the elbows and triceps on the supportive pad
                at all times.

            <p>
                Set an adjustable bench so that you are reclined 15-30 degrees from upright. By performing a dumbbell
                curl on the incline bench, you increase the range of motion that the elbow moves through and minimize
                the amount of shoulder involvement in the curl.

                <br><br>With the dumbbells hanging by your side, perform a dumbbell curl, making sure to not let the
                elbows move forward or backwards, but rather tasty fixed where they start from.

                <br><br><b>TIP:</b>Use less weight than you think, as this is a pretty isolated movement. You can also
                perform a slightly isometric hold at the top of the movement.

                To perform the barbell curl, you will want to grab a barbell with the hands at about shoulder width, and
                stand tall, making sure your chest is up and elbows are down by the sides of the ribs. Perform a curl,
                making sure your elbows stay in line with your body, or even push them forwards as you curl (do not let
                the elbows move backwards). Curl the bar to about face level, making sure your elbows stay tucked into
                the body, then slowly lower the bar and repeat.

                <br><br><b>TIP:</b>Make sure your elbows do not move backwards as you curl, but rather keep them tucked
                into the body, and push the elbows slightly forward as you curl.

                The dumbbell hammer curl can be done seated or standing.

                <br><br>To do this, grab a pair of dumbbells and turn the palms facing in towards your body. Set
                yourself up like any other bicep curl, and curl the weights upwards, thumbs facing up, making sure the
                elbows stay into the body and they do not move backwards as you lift the weights.

                <br><br>After a brief pause at the top of the rep, lower the weights and repeat.

                <br><br><b>TIP:</b>Keep the elbows in front of the body (from the side view) to best remove the shoulder
                muscles from the movement.

            <p>
                To perform the assisted dip, place the knees on the pad (the more weight on the machine, the easier it
                is).

                <br><br>Place the hands on the bars, and pull your shoulders back.

                <br><br>As you dip down, let your chest lean forward, and keep the elbows into the body, making sure it
                feels the stretch in the lower chest and triceps. Your shoulders should NOT fall forward.

                <br><br>To perform the strict dip, do everything the same as above, just do them unsupported on dip
                bars. You can add extra resistance by wearing a weight belt or holding a dumbbell between your thighs.

                <br><br><b>TIP:</b>Allow a slight lean forward throughout the full range of motion, and never let your
                hips move forward, as this will pull your torso upright too much.

            <p>
                To perform the skullcrusher, you can use the barbell or dumbbells.

                <br><br>If you are doing it with a barbell, grab the bar with a slightly narrower than shoulder width
                grip, and extend the elbows so that the bar is above your forward. With the elbows not allowed to flare
                out, bend the elbows and bring the bar down to the forehead, and then extend the elbows, making sure
                they do not flare out.

                <br><br>If you use dumbbells, you will do the same set up and elbows flexion and extension, however your
                wrists may be more or less rotated based on your individual preferences. The dumbbells themselves should
                touch just above the front delt.

                <br><br><b>TIP:</b>Make sure you master this exercise with less weight than you think you need. Once you
                get it, then train with heavier loads.

            <p>
                To perform this, grab a barbell with a slightly narrower than shoulder width grip.

                <br><br>The arms should start above the head, with the elbows fully extended.

                <br><br>Lower the barbell behind the head, making sure the elbows do not flare outwards, but rather
                point forward or towards the sky, as you bend the elbow. You should feel a stretch in the back of the
                arm (triceps).

                <br><br>Once you get to the bottom of the movement, extend the elbows fully, and repeat.

                <br><br><b>TIP:</b>As you lower the weight, try to push the elbows up and back, to get a deeper stretch
                on the triceps.

            <p>
                To perform the cable triceps pushdown, start by standing facing the cable stack, with the attachment in
                your hands.

                <br><br>Place your elbows by your sides, and slightly lean forward, with the elbows bent and the
                attachment up by your face.

                <br><br>With the chest up, and elbows still down by your sides, extend the elbows and push the arms
                straight, making sure that your elbows do not move backwards.

                <br><br>The attachment should end over your toes, not on your thighs.

                <br><br>When fully extended, make sure to feel the triceps, then slowly allow them to rebend, making
                sure to control the full eccentric phase of the movement.

                <br><br><b>TIP:</b>Lock the body in place, and only allow the elbows to open and close (flexion and
                extension). Any more movement and that is not from the triceps.
