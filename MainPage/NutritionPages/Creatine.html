            What Is Creatine?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Creatine is an organic acid naturally produced by the body.
            It can also be obtained from food or supplementation. It
            plays a critical role in forming the specific energy
            needed to create muscular force and movement. Depending
            on your muscular need for force, your body uses
            different primary fuels. When you are doing something
            for a long time at a low intensity, your body likes
            to use fat as its main fuel. As you crank up the
            intensity, your body looks to stored carbohydrates
            for energy. When you are doing things at a very
            high intensity of muscular force, lifting weights, short sprints (under 8-15 seconds or so), plyometrics,
            etc., your body uses a very specific method for obtaining the large amounts of energy rapidly needed.
            Creatine is one of the primary “fuels” involved with this process.

            When To Use Creatine
        </h2>
        <p>
            Research suggests that taking creatine after a workout is
            most optimal. It's better for increasing lean muscle mass
            when combined with a resistance training program.
            It may even have more benefits when taking it with
            a high-carb or high-carb/high-protein post-workout meal.<sup><a href=" https://www.interviewarea.com/faq/when-should-i-take-creatine-for-best-results" style="color:aquamarine; font-size: 12">*
            </a></sup> <br><br>
            However, taking creatine before or even during a
            workout is beneficial as well. Taking it
            consistently is more important than the exact
            timing, so it's better to take it at a time that
            you're most likely to remember.<sup><a href="https://fitbod.me/blog/creatine-before-or-after-workout/" style="color:aquamarine; font-size: 12">*

            <br><br>
            <b>Do Keep In Mind:</b><br>
            If you are maximizing the effects of proper sleep,
            nutrition, and training, and you could use just a
            bit more explosive energy, then creatine will almost
            certainly provide you with that result. If you are
            thinking that creatine can help you in spite of your poor
            sleep patterns, crappy diet, and inconsistent training regimen,
            think again.<sup><a href="https://peakathletictraining.com/creatine-for-everyone/" style="color:aquamarine; font-size: 12">*

        <h2>
            Why Do People Take Creatine Supplements?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The most common use of creatine supplements is to help
            attain bodybuilding goals. lFast movements use
            a different energy system than aerobic exercises. It mainly uses
            creatine, so in theory the higher creatine stores
            you have, the more time you have until you fatigue.
            <br><br>
            If you're exercising at your maximum intensity, your body
            literally can't produce enough ATP to keep up. That's
            where creatine supplements come in: They can help increase
            your body's stores of phosphocreatine (an organic
            compound of creatine and phosphoric acid that's stored
            in your muscle tissue)
            to produce new ATP during high-intensity exercise.
            <br><br>
            <b>The Bottom Line:</b>
            <br>
            If you’re interested in boosting your muscle mass and
            strength or exercising harder for longer, creatine could
            be something worth adding to your dietary routine. But
            if you’re fine opting for the lighter weights or
            less-intense intervals, just make sure to eat plenty of
            protein-rich
            animal foods, and your body will be just fine.<sup><a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/supplements/creatine/" style="color:aquamarine; font-size: 12">*

            How Does Creatine Work?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Creatine is found throughout your body, with
            95% of it stored in your muscles.<br><br>
            It is obtained from meat and fish and can also be produced
            naturally in your body from amino acids.
            <br><br>
            ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) is the body's energy source. When your body oxidizes
            carbs, protein, or fat, it is doing this process in order to produce ATP. ATP is the energy responsible for
            driving almost every body process there is. (ATP is even involved in creating more ATP.)
            ATP provides this energy by hydrolyzing a phosphate group.
            When a phosphate group is
            hydrolyzed, energy in the form of heat is given off and
            this energy is used to drive whatever process is being
            performed, for example, muscle contraction. Because one
            phosphate has been lost from the ATP, it is now called
            ADP (adenosine di-phosphate). Now you have free ADP as a
            product from the ATP hydrolysis.<br><br>
            ADP is pretty much useless in the body unless it is
            converted back into ATP. Now this is where creatine
            comes into play. After creatine enters the body (or after it is produced by the body) it firsts binds
            with a phosphate molecule to form creatine phosphate.
            The creatine works by donating its
            phosphate group to the ADP to re-form ATP. By allowing you to return
            ADP to ATP, creatine will increase your
            ATP stores, thus allowing you to train harder and longer.<sup><a href=" https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/creatine-what-it-is-and-how-it-works.html " style="color:aquamarine; font-size: 12">*

        <h2>
            How safe is creatine?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Creatine is a relatively safe supplement with few side effects reported. However, you should keep in mind
            that:<br><br>

            If you take creatine supplements, you may gain weight
            because of water retention in your body's muscles. It
            will take seven to 28 days to see energy effects depending
            on how much creatine you already have in your body.

            <br><br>It may be dangerous to take creatine supplements when
            you are actually dehydrated or trying to lose weight.

            <br><br>The International Society of Sports Nutrition recently
            found no scientific evidence that short- or long-term use
            of creatine monohydrate causes any harmful effects on
            otherwise healthy individuals. Nevertheless, always
            contact your healthcare provider before taking creatine
            or any supplements.

            <b>NOTE:<br> </b>
            Micronized creatine is creatine that has
            particles up to 20 times smaller than normal
            creatine.
            
            The purpose of micronized creatine is that
            the smaller particles of creatine absorb better
            into your liquid, which means you won't have
            clumps of creatine in the bottom of your glass
            that you can't drink.
            
            What manufacturers claim about micronized
            creatine is that because the particles are
            smaller, your body will absorb more creatine.
            
            The thing is, there is no scientific data to
            support this claim or way to show, without
            scientific studies, how much creatine the body
            is absorbing.
