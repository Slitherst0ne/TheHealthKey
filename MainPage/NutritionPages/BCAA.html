    <h2>Who can benefit from BCAAs?</h2>
    <p>
        During a workout, these benefits make it possible for the
        user to push themselves harder and for longer periods of time. These compounds can even fight exercise-induced
        fatigue,
        and they take effect much more quickly than your typical protein supplement. But, can you take amino acids
        without working
        out? The answer is a (very conditional) yes.

        For the vast majority of people, there isn't much of a downside to taking amino acids without
        working out. These are substances that the body needs, after all, and in moderate doses they should
        not produce any negative reactions, provided you don't have a condition or disorder that affects how your
        body processes amino acids -- maple syrup urine disease<sup><a href="https://www.amino-vital.com/blogs/new/can-i-take-amino-acids-without-working-out#:~:text=Taking%20Amino%20Acid%20Supplements%20Without%20Working%20Out&text=But%2C%20can%20you%20take%20amino,amino%20acids%20without%20working%20out."style ="color:aquamarine; font-size: 14">*</a> </sup>

    <h3>Who Should Avoid BCAA's?</h3>
    <p>
        Taking BCAA supplements is generally safe and without side effects for most people.
        However, individuals with a rare congenital disorder called

    <h2>
        What are BCAA's?
    </h2>
    <p>
        BCAA - Branched Chain Amino Acids<br><br>

        BCAA is a general term for the essential amino acids
        valine, leucine, and isoleucine that are metabolized
        by the body and used as sources of muscle energy. They're
        “essential” because your body doesn't make them on its
        own—you have to get them from food and workout supplements.
        Like other amino acids, they're the building blocks of
        protein. But these particular aminos may also help
        preserve muscle glycogen stores, which fuel your
        muscles and minimize protein breakdown during exercise.<br><br> Translation?
        BCAAs can help you get more out of your daily gym sessions.

    <h2>
        Why should you consider BCAA's?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Let's consider a person who wants to achieve a lean physique
        and aspires for the perfect body through training
        and good nutrition. For leaning up, The training program
        would involve some cardio with a calorie
        deficit diet. BCAAs can protect you from catabolism, which is when
        your body breakdowns muscle, as well as fat, for energy.
        <br><br>

        So if you are cutting and in a calorie deficit then BCAAs
        are very important to prevent muscle loss. Exercising
        in a calorie deficit means there are no glycogen stores
        available for energy, so muscle protein("Your Gains") is broken down
        into amino acids that can be utilized as energy. By
        supplementing with BCAA's you can saturate your muscles to
        provide adequate muscle energy and an anabolic environment.

    <h2>
        How much BCAA should be taken Per day?
    </h2>
    <p>
        A good rule of thumb for the proper
        BCAA dosage is at least 12 grams per day for a man and 9
        per day for a woman. However, remember that this
        is a baseline figure and may not apply to everyone.
        Another guideline that can help both men and women is
        to aim for around 65 mg of BCAAs per pound of body
        weight.<br><br> For those who are especially active, going
        as high as 18-20 grams of BCAAs per day may be
        beneficial, though most people will not see much
        improvement compared to the baseline amounts mentioned above.

    <h2>
        When Should I take them?
    </h2>
    <p>
        It's best to take BCAA supplements — whether tablet or
        powder form — before a workout, up to 15 minutes
        pre-workout. But BCAAs can be taken up to three times
        a day overall, depending on serving size — so be sure
        to read the label.
        <sup><a href="https://hc2gym.com/nutrition/how-much-bcaa-should-you-drink.html" style="color:aquamarine; font-size: 12">*
        </a></sup><br><br>
        Taking BCAAs during workouts has been studied a little in endurance training,
        such as distance running and cycling.
        When 193 men taking part in a marathon took
        16 grams of BCAAs during the event, they didn't
        run any faster than men who took a placebo.
        Additionally, research in cyclists has failed to show an improvement in physical performance from taking BCAAs
        during endurance exercise, though the
        supplements may help reduce mental fatigue
