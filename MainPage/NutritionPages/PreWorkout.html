            You cannot expect yourself to be feeling 100% before every workout.
            Sometimes, you'll go to the gym feeling tired, lethargic
            and unmotivated, and if that sounds familiar, finding the
            best pre-workout may be all that's needed to alleviate your lack of energy.

            <!-- You're going to hit a road block at some point in your life.
            Exhaustion may consume you and you may even feel overwhelemed. That's life
            we get it, it happens. Pre-workout is that option you would take if coffee was
            not available and you needed a quick boost of energy. Of course, there's other options to 
            get your caffeine--Green and Black tea. Energy drinks also, but sheesh, If I had the choice between
            pre workout and energy drinks, I would personally choose pre workout. 
            <br>
            I just stand as a firm believer that you don't really need preworkout unless you are feeling
            overly exhausted or its game time mentality. All time is game time, but we know personally when we could use a nice little  -->

        <h2>What Is a Pre-workout Supplement?</h2>
        <p>
            A pre-workout supplement can boost any high-intensity,
            endurance, or strength-training exercise.
            <br><br>
            A pre-workout is a supplement that can increase energy levels, improve exercise
            performance, and stimulate muscle growth. Athletes, particularly runners and
            weightlifters, use pre-workout supplements
            before exercises like weightlifting or HIIT (high-intensity interval training).
            <br><br>
            The ingredients and effects of pre-workout supplements vary by product, but most
            products use ingredients like caffeine to provide an energy boost or creatine to
            help increase muscle mass. Athletes typically consume pre-workout supplements as
            pills or as powders mixed into drinks or soft foods. You can also mix pre-workout supplements
            with protein powders, which can help stimulate protein synthesis and build muscle.

            <b>Common Ingredients in Pre workout:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b style="color:rgb(240, 81, 81)">L-Arginine:</b> Arginine is responsible for regulating the levels of
                nitric oxide
                in your body, which causes the blood vessels to relax and improve blood flow. </li><br>
            <li><b style="color:rgb(240, 81, 81)">Nitrate:</b>Nitrate salts convert into nitric oxide when ingested,
                which can improve blood circulation and allow oxygen-rich blood to enter the heart. This helps your body
                to use oxygen more efficiently
                during endurance workouts. Nitrates are often labeled or sold as a beetroot extract </li><br>
            <li><b style="color:rgb(240, 81, 81)">Creatine monohydrate:</b>Creatine is an organic
                compound naturally created in the kidneys and liver that is converted into adenosine
                triphosphate (ATP) during intense exercise. Your body uses ATP as an energy source
                during high-intensity workouts. Increasing creatine intake can increase the intensity
                and duration of
                your workouts, and may improve overall strength and muscle-building potential. </li><br>
            <li><b style="color:rgb(240, 81, 81)">L-Citrulline:</b>Citrulline is a non-essential
                amino acid that helps the body produce more nitric oxide, which improves the body's
                overall blood flow and may accelerate the
                body's natural removal of lactic acid, which causes muscle soreness. </li><br>
            <li><b style="color:rgb(240, 81, 81)">Î²-alanine:</b>Beta-alanine is a non-essential
                amino acid very common in pre-workout supplements. Beta-alanine can prevent muscle
                fatigue during exercise by increasing the body's concentration of carnosine, a
                naturally occurring
                compound that helps prevent muscle inflammation and acts as an antioxidant. </li><br>
            <li><b style="color:rgb(240, 81, 81)">B vitamins:</b>B vitamins, like Vitamin B3
                or Vitamin B12, are common in pre-workouts to help improve the body's metabolism
                of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.
                These vitamins can increase an athlete's amount of energy. </li><br>
            <li><b style="color:rgb(240, 81, 81)">BCAA:</b> Branched-chain amino acids include
                the essential amino acids leucine, valine, and isoleucine. BCAAs do not occur
                naturally in the body, so athletes consume these amino acids with food and supplements.
                BCAAs are the building blocks of protein and aid in muscle synthesis, meaning
                they help to increase muscle mass and provide energy to your muscles during exercise.

        <h2>Who Should and Should not take Pre-Workout? </h2>
        <p>
            If you are a healthy individual with no underlying health problems, pre-workout is
            safe for consumption. However, pre-workout may not be suitable for everyone, mainly
            due to its caffeine content. If you fall into one of the
            below groups, speak with your doctor before consuming any supplements.

            <b>Avoid taking pre-workout if you:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Are pregnant</li>
                <li>Have heart disease, including things such as hypertension,
                     arrhythmias, or a fast heart rate</li>
                <li>Are sensitive to caffeine</li>

        <h2>When is the Best Time to Take Pre-Workout?</h2>
        <p>
            As the name suggests, pre-workout should be taken before a workout, and although
            many people drink it on their way to the gym or during their workout, it should
            be taken at least 30 to 60 minutes prior to hitting the weights or cardio machines.

        <h2>Why should a person consider Pre-Workout Supplements?</h2>
        <p>

            Don't believe in the power of pre-workout? Well, a study published in the
            Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition reported that combining
            pre-workout with HIIT workouts resulted in significant increases in VO2 max,
            training volume and lean body mass while
            also speeding up the rate at which moderately trained recreational
            athletes lost body fat.

            <b>NOTE:</b>
            Pre-workout supplements can raise your heart rate, combining them with strenuous
            cardiovascular activity can put excess strain on the heart. Other less-serious
            side effects can include a jittery feeling, increased energy, headaches and nausea.
