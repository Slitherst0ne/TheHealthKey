        <h2>What is Protein?</h2>
        <p>
            Protein is a macronutrient that is essential to building
            muscle mass. It is commonly found in animal products and also present
            in other sources, such as nuts and legumes.<sup><a href=" https://www.livescience.com/53044-protein.html "

            <br><br>
            Protein is one of the building
            blocks of bone, muscle, and skin. The body needs
            it to produce hormones, enzymes, and other chemicals.

                <li><b style="color:rgb(235, 128, 28)">Whey:</b>This water-soluble milk protein is popular among
                    athletes. It is a complete protein,
                    meaning that it contains all of the amino acids that the human body requires from food. The body
                    absorbs whey protein quickly and easily.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b style="color: rgb(235, 128, 28)">Casein: </b> This type of protein is rich in glutamine, an amino
                    acid that may speed up muscle
                    recovery after exercise. Casein comes from dairy, making it unsuitable for vegans and people with
                    milk allergies. The body digests this protein more slowly, so it may be best to take it at night.
                </li>
                <br>

                <li><b style="color: rgb(235, 128, 28)">Soy:</b>Soy protein is an excellent alternative to whey or
                    casein for people who do not consume
                    dairy. It also contains all the essential amino acids.

                <li><b style="color:rgb(235, 128, 28)">Pea:</b>Many plant-based protein powders contain pea protein,
                    which is a high-quality alternative
                    to soy- and dairy-based proteins. Pea protein is a good source of the amino acid arginine. </li>

                    essential fatty acids. This makes
                    hemp an excellent choice for vegans or those with dairy or soy allergies. </li>

        <h2>Who should be taking protein?</h2>
        <p>
            Research suggests older adults and exercisers looking to support muscle growth may benefit from eating
            one-and-a-half to two times as much protein as the RDA. As we age we lose muscle, and research shows
            boosting protein may help increase strength and lean body mass.

            For the vast majority of people, getting protein from their would not be difficult, so there’s no need to
            spend a lot of time and money looking for a protein powder.
            <br>
            But if you’re struggling to get enough protein in your diet, or if you need more protein
            than the average person because of your strenuous workouts, then a shake might help with that. It really
            comes down to your lifestyle, your needs, and your preferences.

        <h2>Should You Take Protein Before Bed?</h2>
        <p>
            Taking protein before
            bed may be an effective strategy to help build muscle, increase strength and
            improve exercise performance and recovery. Elderly people looking to preserve
            muscle mass may also benefit from taking protein before bed.

           <br><br> If you want to take protein before bed, you may consider taking a form of casein protein. Casein is digested
            slowly, which means it can provide the body with a steady supply of protein through the night

            <br><br>You can also get the benefits of casein protein from real foods instead of supplements. Dairy products like
            cottage cheese and Greek yogurt are high in casein.<sup><a href="https://www.rzonefitness.com/2018/02/when-is-the-best-time-to-take-protein/" style="color:aquamarine; font-size: 12">*
